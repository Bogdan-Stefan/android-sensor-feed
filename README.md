## Description
This is a minimal client-server application used to receive sensor readings from android devices via web sockets.

## Observations
* Just like my [Python3 REST Api](https://github.com/Bogdan-Stefan/python3-rest-api), this project has been created for educational purposes. It's not perfect and I'm learning from my mistakes.
* The server is written in python3 using [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org/) and [ws4py](https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python).
* The client is a native android app. The only external library used is [Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket).
* Server supports multiple connected clients.
